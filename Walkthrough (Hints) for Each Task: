Task 1: SSH Brute Force
Hint: Look for repeated failed login attempts from the same IP address. After several failed attempts, see if thereâ€™s any successful login.
Explanation: The attacker likely used brute-force techniques to guess the SSH credentials. Once they gained access, they proceeded to execute more malicious commands.

Task 2: Reverse Shell Execution
Hint: Search for any commands related to downloading files (e.g., wget) or executing shell commands (e.g., bash or nc).
Explanation: After gaining SSH access, the attacker tried to set up a reverse shell. By analyzing the bash history, you can pinpoint the commands they executed to achieve this.

Task 3: Privilege Escalation
Hint: Review the bash history for commands executed with sudo or other signs of privilege escalation.
Explanation: The attacker escalated their privileges using a reverse shell and system misconfigurations. Understanding the commands they used for this step is crucial.

Task 4: Persistence Mechanism
Hint: Check the cron logs for any new cron jobs that might be suspicious. The attacker may have added a new cron job to ensure access remains persistent.
Explanation: Attackers often create cron jobs to execute malicious scripts periodically, ensuring that their access isn't lost after reboot or service restart.
